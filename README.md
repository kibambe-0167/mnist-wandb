# mnist-wandb
Training a cnn classifier model using pytorch on the mnist dataset. Then use weights and biases on the model/process for my learning purposes

- The purpose of this repo, is not to show my skills with deep learning, this is just base model made.
- Purpose is to show a simple model, using weights and biases platform for model training and tracking - Not deployment of model is demostrated
